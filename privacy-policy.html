                        information was initially collected, we will provide you with information about that other

                        We may share your Personal Information with third parties:<br>

                        • With your consent. We share some of your Personal Information if you affirmatively consent to
                        it. For example, we may share Personal Information with other users of the App if you choose to

                        functions, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Policy
                        by making similar commitments. For example, billing and payment information collected through
                        the App may be shared with third party payment processors.<br>

                        • For legal disclosure. We may share your information with third parties when we reasonably
                        believe disclosure is required or permitted in order to comply with a subpoena, court order or
                        other applicable law, regulation or legal process.<br>

                        • To protect us or others. We may share your information to the extent we believe that sharing
                        such information is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our products or
                        services, our customers, or others.<br>

                        • As aggregate information. We may share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying
                        information internally or with others for purposes of research, reporting, and benchmarking.<br>

                        • As a result of merger or sale of our business. We may share Personal Information if we are
                        involved in a merger, sale, financing, liquidation, bankruptcy or acquisition of corporate
                        entities or business units.<br>


                        We do not sell any Personal Information for any reason.<br>

                        4. Data Access and Control<br>

                        If you allow consumers to control certain Personal Information through other methods, such as a
                        user account or user profile, you should describe how the consumer can control information
                        through those methods here.<br>

                        5. Data Retention<br>

                        We retain your Personal Information according to applicable laws or regulatory requirements and
                        keep it as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for
                        which the personal data was collected.<br>

                        6. Data Security<br>

                        While no online service is 100% secure, we work to protect information about you against
                        unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We
                        encrypt Personal Information with the Advanced Encryption Standard both when it is stored and
                        when it is retrieved. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks, and we
                        use a variety of security technologies and organizational procedures to help protect your
                        personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also
                        limit access to your Personal Information to those personnel with a need to know in order to
                        perform job duties for us.<br>

                        7. Children’s Privacy<br>

                        We do not collect Personal Information about or from persons under the age of thirteen. If you
                        are under the age of thirteen you CANNOT use the App.<br>


                        8. Third Party Links<br>

                        We may provide content on the Services that links to third-party websites. For example, we may
                        post links to our social media profiles so you can find us easily. We do not control, and are
                        not responsible for, third parties’ privacy practices and content. When you click on a link to a
                        third-party site, the third party may collect your personal information, which will be governed
                        by the third party’s privacy policy. Please read the third party’s privacy policy to learn about
                        how they collect and process your personal information.<br>

                        9. Additional Privacy Rights<br>
